# Tree

## Key Points

**Principles**

1. The `diameter` is the largest value of `sum(max_depth_of_left_subtree, max_depth_of_right_subtree)` of all of nodes of the tree

**Traverse**
1. BF
    * Usually based on `Queue`
    * Can also use recursive
2. DF
    * PreOrder
    * InOrder
    * PostOrder


## Thinking Patterns
1. Tree Traverse. `Traverse` 
2. Recursive with sub trees. `Sub Tasks`

> 二叉树解题的思维模式分两类：
1、是否可以通过遍历一遍二叉树得到答案？如果可以，用一个 traverse 函数配合外部变量来实现，这叫「遍历」的思维模式。
2、是否可以定义一个递归函数，通过子问题（子树）的答案推导出原问题的答案？如果可以，写出这个递归函数的定义，并充分利用这个函数的返回值，这叫「分解问题」的思维模式。
无论使用哪种思维模式，你都需要思考：
如果单独抽出一个二叉树节点，它需要做什么事情？需要在什么时候（前/中/后序位置）做？其他的节点不用你操心，递归函数会帮你在所有节点上执行相同的操作。

**Complete Binary Tree**
  * Principle
    > According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

    * For any node, if it has children, then, there must be at least 1 `Perfect Binary Tree` in it's children. 
    
**Perfect Binary Tree**
  * Principle
    * Every level of the tree is full
